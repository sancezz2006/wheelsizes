So why is this so important? What is actually the meaning? PCD consists of the diameter of the circle that passes through the center of all the wheel bolts, the number of these bolt holes and the wheel offset.

## The bolt pattern table
The bolt pattern describes how many bolts or lug nuts that are used for fitting a wheel, and of course what the pitch circle diameter / PCD is (bolt circle diameter). For example, ”5/114,3″ or "5*114,3", where number "5" describes the number of holes and "114,3" is the pitch circle diameter

For example
